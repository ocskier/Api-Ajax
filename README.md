* [`index.html] (Api-Ajax-Hw/index.html)

### Instructions

* This is an app for searching multiple databases for sports related gifs

* The app starts with a preselected amount of buttons with sports activities

* The user will then either click on a preselected sport or enter a new one in

    the search field

* If the user picks one and it is a valid search term or not empty then the search
    will commence and a new button will be added

* The app will pull random gifs from either Giphy or Tenor

* The user can clear all search gifs from the button

* Any search result can be deleted with the checkbox or added to favorites bar

* All gifs can be paused or restarted by clicking on the gif

* Have fun! This game can also be found in my portfolio @ https://ocskier.github.io/JRJ-Folio
